# Zeroes of polynomials

Here is the code used to create the images from my [TEDxUL
talk](http://tedxul.si/speakers/andrej-bauer/), and some extras. It is all released under
the permissive [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so please have fun with
it and send me improvements (as `git` pull requests if possible).
